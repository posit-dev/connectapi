# connectapi <img src='man/figures/logo.svg' align="right" height="139" />

This package provides an R client for the [Posit Connect Server
API](https://docs.posit.co/connect/api/), as well as helpful functions
that utilize the client. It is designed to work with all supported
versions of Connect, though some features may only be available to newer
versions.

## Installation

To install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("connectapi")
```

To install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github('rstudio/connectapi')
```

## Client

To create a client:

``` r
library(connectapi)
client <- connect(
  server = "https://connect.example.com",
  api_key = "<SUPER SECRET API KEY>"
)
```

You can also define the following environment variables (in a
`.Renviron` file, for instance):

    CONNECT_SERVER  = https://connect.example.com
    CONNECT_API_KEY = my-secret-api-key

These environment variable values will be used automatically if defined
in your R session.

``` r
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()
```

## Getting Started

Once a client is defined, you can use it to interact with Posit Connect.

### Exploring Data

You can use the `get_` methods to retrieve data from the Posit Connect
server.

``` r
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()

# get data
users <- get_users(client)
groups <- get_groups(client)
usage_shiny <- get_usage_shiny(client)
usage_static <- get_usage_static(client)
some_content <- get_content(client)

# get all content
all_content <- get_content(client, limit = Inf)
```

### Deployment

The `rsconnect` package is usually used for deploying content to
Connect. However, if you want to use programmatic deployment with the
Posit Connect Server API, then these `connectapi` helpers should be
useful!

``` r
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()

# deploying content
# NOTE: a `manifest.json` should already exist from `rsconnect::writeManifest()`

bundle <- bundle_dir("./path/to/directory")
content <- client %>%
  deploy(bundle, name = "my-app-name") %>%
  poll_task()

# set an image for content

content %>%
  set_image_path("./my/local/image.png")

content %>%
  set_image_url("http://url.example.com/image.png")

# set image and a vanity URL

content %>%
  set_image_path("./my/local/image.png") %>%
  set_vanity_url("/my-awesome-app")

# change access_type to "anyone"

content$update(access_type = "all")

# edit another piece of content

client %>%
  content_item("the-content-guid") %>%
  set_vanity_url("/another-awesome-app")

# migrate content to another server

client_prod <- connect(
  server = "prod.example.com",
  api_key = "my-secret-key"
)

prod_bnd <- client %>%
  content_item("the-guid-to-promote") %>%
  download_bundle()

client_prod %>%
  deploy(prod_bnd, title = "Now in Production") %>%
  set_vanity_url("/my-app")

# open a browser to the content item
client_prod %>% browse_dashboard()
client_prod %>% browse_solo()

# open a browser to the docs
client_prod %>% browse_api_docs()
```

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

**Access Denied Errors?**

This is likely due to either (1) `Connect$server` or `Connect$api_key`
being defined improperly or (2) you do not have access to the Posit
Connect cluster to do the operation in question

**Warning about version numbers**

We test the package against a range of versions of Connect, as old as
1.8.8.2 (May 2021). If your Connect server is older than that, the
package may still work, but `connectapi` will warn you.

We strive to:

- track the latest version of the Posit Connect API
- add new features as they come available and have demand
- maintain backwards compatibility

These priorities are sometimes at odds, and sometimes they create
inconsistencies between versions as a result. To mitigate this, we
recommend:

- Track the version of `connectapi` in use for your applications by
  using `renv`
- Test high value content that uses `connectapi` before updating
  `connectapi` or Posit Connect
- Update Posit Connect to the latest version *first* when an update to
  `connectapi` is needed

**Error - Need to update Posit Connect**

As a helpful clarification for users, we have added error messages to
API requests when the version implemented in the package specifically
introduces a backwards incompatible dependency on older versions of
Posit Connect.

If you get this error message, our recommendation would be:

- Look at [`NEWS.md`](./NEWS.md) to find the moment the change was
  introduced
- Downgrade `connectapi` to the previous version of the package
- (Advanced) Use the “blame” feature on GitHub to track commits and find
  out when the error was introduced

Please feel free to open an Issue if you think there is a bug, or ask a
free-form question on [Posit
Community](https://forum.posit.co/c/posit-professional-hosted/posit-connect/27)
