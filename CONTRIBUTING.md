# Contributing to connectapi

This outlines how to propose a change to connectapi.
For more detailed info about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the
[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib).

## Local development and testing

We recommend using the devtools package when developing connectapi.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

`devtools::load_all()` will load the current state of the package, simulating a
user running `library("connectapi")`. Use this when locally trying out changes
to the code.

### Running tests

There are two test suites in the package.
One contains unit tests and tests that use API mocks, so you can run them without access to a running Connect server.

Run these in R with:

```r
devtools::test()
```

Or with the provided justfile:

```
just unit-tests
```

A second suite runs integration tests against a live Connect server running
locally in Docker. This has some additional requirements. To run these, you need
a valid Connect license file (`.lic` file). Place it in the root of the
repository as `connect-license.lic`. You also need Docker installed, and to
install the [`with-connect` tool](https://github.com/posit-dev/with-connect).

```
uv tool install git+https://github.com/posit-dev/with-connect.git
just integration-tests           # uses "release" by default
just integration-tests 2024.06.0 # use a specific version
```

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file.
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github("posit-dev/connectapi", fork = TRUE)`.

*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`.
    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing.
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.

### Code style

*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests.
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
