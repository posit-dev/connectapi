\title{Get information about content on the Posit Connect server}
\usage{
get_content(src, guid = NULL, owner_guid = NULL, name = NULL, ..., .p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{src}{A Connect object}

\item{guid}{The guid for a particular content item}

\item{owner_guid}{The unique identifier of the user who owns the content}

\item{name}{The content name specified when the content was created}

\item{...}{Extra arguments. Currently not used.}

\item{.p}{Optional. A predicate function, passed as-is to \code{purrr::keep()}
before turning the response into a tibble. Can be useful for performance.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{guid}: The unique identifier of this content item.
\item \code{name}: A simple, URL-friendly identifier. Allows alpha-numeric
characters, hyphens ("-"), and underscores ("_").
\item \code{title}: The title of this content.
\item \code{description}: A rich description of this content
\item \code{access_type}: Access type describes how this content manages its
viewers. It may have a value of \code{all}, \code{logged_in} or \code{acl}.
The value \code{all} is the most permissive; any visitor to Posit
Connect will be able to view this content. The value \code{logged_in}
indicates that all Posit Connect accounts may view the content. The
\code{acl} value lets specifically enumerated users and groups view the
content. Users configured as collaborators may always view content.
\item \code{connection_timeout}: Maximum number of seconds allowed without data
sent or received across a client connection. A value of 0 means
connections will never time-out (not recommended). When null, the
default \code{Scheduler.ConnectionTimeout} is used. Applies only to content
types that are executed on demand.
\item \code{read_timeout}: Maximum number of seconds allowed without data received
from a client connection. A value of 0 means a lack of client (browser)
interaction never causes the connection to close. When null, the default
\code{Scheduler.ReadTimeout} is used. Applies only to content types that are
executed on demand.
\item \code{init_timeout}: The maximum number of seconds allowed for an interactive
application to start. Posit Connect must be able to connect
to a newly launched Shiny application, for example, before this threshold
has elapsed. When null, the default \code{Scheduler.InitTimeout} is
used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand.
\item \code{idle_timeout}: The maximum number of seconds a worker process
for an interactive application to remain alive after it goes idle (no
active connections). When null, the default \code{Scheduler.IdleTimeout}
is used. Applies only to content types that are executed on demand.
\item \code{max_processes}: Specifies the total number of concurrent processes
allowed for a single interactive application. When null, the
default \code{Scheduler.MaxProcesses} setting is used. Applies only to
content types that are executed on demand.
\item \code{min_processes}: Specifies the minimum number of concurrent
processes allowed for a single interactive application. When null, the
default \code{Scheduler.MinProcesses} is used. Applies only to content types
that are executed on demand.
\item \code{max_conns_per_process}: Specifies the maximum number of
client connections allowed to an individual process. Incoming connections
which will exceed this limit are routed to a new process or rejected.
When null, the default \code{Scheduler.MaxConnsPerProcess} is used. Applies
only to content types that are executed on demand.
\item \code{load_factor}: Controls how aggressively new processes are spawned.
When null, the default \code{Scheduler.LoadFactor} is used. Applies only to
content types that are executed on demand.
\item \code{created_time}: The timestamp (RFC3339) indicating when this
content was created.
\item \code{last_deployed_time}: The timestamp (RFC3339) indicating when
this content last had a successful bundle deployment performed.
\item \code{bundle_id}: The identifier for the active deployment bundle.
Automatically assigned upon the successful deployment of that bundle.
\item \code{app_mode}: The runtime model for this content. Has a value
of \code{unknown} before data is deployed to this item. Automatically assigned
upon the first successful bundle deployment. Allowed: \code{api},
\code{jupyter-static}, \code{python-api}, \code{python-bokeh}, \code{python-dash},
\code{python-streamlit}, \code{rmd-shiny}, \code{rmd-static}, \code{shiny}, \code{static},
\code{tensorflow-saved-model}, \code{unknown}.
\item \code{content_category}: Describes the specialization of the content
runtime model. Automatically assigned upon the first successful bundle
deployment.
\item \code{parameterized}: True when R Markdown rendered content
allows parameter configuration. Automatically assigned upon the first
successful bundle deployment. Applies only to content with an app_mode
of rmd-static.
\item \code{r_version}: The version of the R interpreter associated
with this content. The value null represents that an R interpreter is
not used by this content or that the R package environment has not been
successfully restored. Automatically assigned upon the successful
deployment of a bundle.
\item \code{py_version}: The version of the Python interpreter
associated with this content. The value null represents that a Python
interpreter is not used by this content or that the Python package
environment has not been successfully restored. Automatically assigned
upon the successful deployment of a bundle.
\item \code{run_as}: The UNIX user that executes this content.
When null, the default Applications.RunAs is used. Applies
only to executable content types - not static.
\item \code{run_as_current_user}: Indicates if this content is allowed
to execute as the logged-in user when using PAM authentication.
Applies only to executable content types - not static.
\item \code{owner_guid}: The unique identifier for the owner
\item \code{content_url}: The URL associated with this content. Computed
from the associated vanity URL or GUID for this content.
\item \code{dashboard_url}: The URL within the Connect dashboard where
this content can be configured. Computed from the GUID for this content.
\item \code{role}: The relationship of the accessing user to this
content. A value of owner is returned for the content owner. editor
indicates a collaborator. The viewer value is given to users who are
permitted to view the content. A none role is returned for
administrators who cannot view the content but are permitted to view
its configuration. Computed at the time of the request.
\item \code{id}: The internal numeric identifier of this content item
