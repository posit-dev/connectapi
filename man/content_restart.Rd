\title{Restart a content item.}
\usage{
content_restart(content)
}
\arguments{
\item{content}{The content item you wish to restart.}
}
\description{
Submit a request to restart a content item. Once submitted, the
server performs an asynchronous request to kill all processes associated with
the content item, starting new processes as needed. This might be useful if
the application relies on data that is loaded at startup, or if its memory
usage has grown over time.

Note that users interacting with certain types of applications may have their
workflows interrupted.

Only valid for interactive content (e.g., applications, APIs).
