\arguments{
\item{src}{the source object}

\item{content_guid}{Filter results by content GUID}

\item{min_data_version}{Filter by data version. Records with a data version
lower than the given value will be excluded from the set of results.}

\item{from}{The timestamp that starts the time window of interest. Any usage
information that ends prior to this timestamp will not be returned.
Individual records may contain a starting time that is before this if they
end after it or have not finished. Must be of class Date or POSIX}

\item{to}{The timestamp that ends the time window of interest. Any usage
information that starts after this timestamp will not be returned.
Individual records may contain an ending time that is after this
(or no ending time) if they start before it. Must be of class Date or
POSIX}

\item{limit}{The number of records to return.}

\item{previous}{Retrieve the previous page of Shiny application usage
logs relative to the provided value. This value corresponds to an internal
reference within the server and should be sourced from the appropriate
attribute within the paging object of a previous response.}

\item{nxt}{Retrieve the next page of Shiny application usage logs
relative to the provided value. This value corresponds to an internal
reference within the server and should be sourced from the appropriate
attribute within the paging object of a previous response.}

\item{asc_order}{Defaults to TRUE; Determines if the response records
should be listed in ascending or descending order within the response.
Ordering is by the started timestamp field.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{content_guid}: The GUID, in RFC4122 format, of the
Shiny application this information pertains to.
\item \code{user_guid}: The GUID, in RFC4122 format, of the user
that visited the application.
\item \code{started}: The timestamp, in RFC3339 format, when the
user opened the application.
\item \code{ended}: The timestamp, in RFC3339 format, when the
user left the application.
\item \code{data_version}: The data version the record was recorded
with. The Shiny Application Events section of the Posit Connect Admin
Guide explains how to interpret data_version values.
